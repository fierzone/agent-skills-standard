## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-01

**Category**: Hybrid Rule Injection & GitHub Copilot Optimization

### Added (CLI v1.6.2)

- **🚀 Hybrid Rule Injection**: Implemented a new "Discovery Pointer" strategy for agent rules.
  - Instead of prepending to existing rule files, the CLI now creates a dedicated `agent-skill-standard-rule.md` (or `.mdc`) in the agent's rules directory.
  - Standardized naming across all agents to avoid file pollution and conflicts.
- **🤖 GitHub Copilot Specialized Support**:
  - Automatically generates `.instructions.md` files in `.github/instructions/`.
  - Injects YAML frontmatter with `applyTo: "**/*"` for repository-wide skill discovery.
- **✨ Cursor & Antigravity Enhancements**:
  - Specialized YAML frontmatter for `.mdc` and `.agent` rules with `globs: ["**/*"]` and `alwaysApply: true`.
- **🛠️ Robust Rule Scoping**: Improved directory detection for rule targets, ensuring hidden folders (dots) are treated as directories, not files.
